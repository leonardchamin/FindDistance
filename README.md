I used angular according to single page architecture. But I have included (commented) a simple razor code, So you would understand How would I use razor if I had to write in razor syntax.

I used code first method in entity framework to connect sql server mdf file. But I didn't try to insert data and process from database.

My code doesn't work well. I tried my best to improve a pattern to get the answer. But I couldn't . So I will leave it to you to decide.
